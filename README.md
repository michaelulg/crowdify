# crowdify
Final project for TAU's data driven crowdsourcing workshop
Crowidify allows you to search songs in Spotify based on their lyrics, themes and more. 
Each user can contribute to our database, it's easy! 
You can just fill a query about your recenetly heard songs, or you can play in our 
specially designed games and earn points, every contribution will help to future users and is much appreciated.

We are a team of 4 in Tel Aviv University's Data driven Crowdsourcing workshop.
This Website is the final product of the workshop. 
You can check-out the codes of the website at this git page, or contact us at: contactcrowdify@gmail.com.
Hope you enjoy it!
